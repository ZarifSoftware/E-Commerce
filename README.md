# ECommerce
My ReactJs based Ecommerce project

Here you will find two folder
1. backend
2.frontend

In backend folder I have created a node js server for firebase admin sdk. At the first of the index.js file you have to give the details of your firebase project.

Then on cmd write npm install

after that write nodemon index.js
and it will start your server.

Then in frontend folder I have created a reactjs project.
On cmd you have to write again npm install for frontend folder. And it will install all the dependencies you need. Then just write npm start. it will start the reactjs project.
